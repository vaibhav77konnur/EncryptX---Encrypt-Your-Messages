Description:
Encrypt is an advanced cryptography application developed using Python and tkinter, designed to secure sensitive information through various encryption algorithms. The application supports three main ciphers: Caesar Cipher for basic substitution encryption, Rail Fence Cipher for transposition encryption, and DES (Data Encryption Standard) for robust data protection. Users can input plaintext, select a cipher method, and generate encrypted text, enhancing data security for personal and professional use cases.

Key Features:

Caesar Cipher: Implements simple substitution encryption based on user-defined shifts.
Rail Fence Cipher: Utilizes transposition techniques to scramble plaintext across multiple "rails".
DES Encryption: Provides strong, block cipher encryption using an 8-character key for secure data protection.
Modern UI: User-friendly interface with intuitive controls for seamless encryption and decryption operations.
Platform: Built in Python with tkinter for cross-platform compatibility.
Technologies Used:
Python, tkinter, Crypto.Cipher (DES), Encryption Algorithms, User Interface Design, Cross-Platform Development.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, cryptography, algorithm implementation, and UI/UX design, showcasing practical skills applicable to software engineering roles focused on security, encryption, and data protection.
